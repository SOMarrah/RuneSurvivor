# 1. � RuneSurvivors

- This is a game based on Runescape for learning purposes.
- The goal of this project was for me to be able to create a unity game using c#.

# 2. � Project Description

The quality of a README description often differentiates a good project from a
bad project. A good project takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and
showcase:

- What your application does
- Why you used the technologies you used
- Challenges faced and ICEBOX concepts you hope to implement in the future



# 3. � Table of Contents

- Make it easy for users to navigate to different sections easily with internal
  links

# 4. � How to Install and Run the Project

- If you are working on a project that requires a user to install packages, or
  run locally, provide a step-by-step description of how to get the environment
  up and running

# 5. How to Use the Project

Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project.
This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem – they will
always have a place to reference what is expected.

You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to
show examples of the running project and also the structure and design
principles used in your project.

Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames,
this is a good section to include the credentials.

# 6. Include Credits

If you worked on the project as a team or an organization, list your
collaborators/team members. You should also include links to their GitHub
profiles and social media too.

Also, if you followed tutorials or referenced a certain material that might help
the user to build that particular project, include links to those here as well.

This is just a way to show your appreciation and also to help others get a first
hand copy of the project.

# 7. Add a License

For most README files, this is usually considered the last part. It lets other
developers know what they can and cannot do with your project.

We have different types of licenses depending on the kind of project you are
working on. Depending on the one you will choose it will determine the
contributions your project gets.

The most common one is the GPL License which allows other to make modification
to your code and use it for commercial purposes. If you need help choosing a
license, use check out this link: https://choosealicense.com/

Up to this point what we have covered are the minimum requirements for a good
README. But you might also want to consider adding the following sections to
make it more eye catching and interactive.
